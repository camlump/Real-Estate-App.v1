# Bluenest Properties

[Deployed App](https://intense-scrubland-29146.herokuapp.com/)


## Overview
This Project is a mock  real estate webiste that allows users to list properties that they either want to sell or rent-out, and also gives users the ability to see what properties are available for sale and rent. This application is not developed for the purchasing of any real properties and is soley for personal use.


## Technologies used 

Bluenest is created with using the MERN stack where **Mongodb** is used to hold all of the entire house data for each individual house, while cloudinary is used to image storage for each house. **Node.js**, and **Express** are used to create the backend routes for the data to send request to the client. **React.js** is used on the front-end to display house information.



## Future implementation

- In the future I plan to fully use redux for state managment on the front-end.
- Create email functionality to contact about a specific house.

- Add user functionality to the application.
